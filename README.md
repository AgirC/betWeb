    3. his/her info (name and capital) 
    4. chart with the info of the last 5 bets
He/she can bet on the events that are not finished
The user has to click on an event to display the detail
The options to bet depends on the event, some times the user can bet to 1, X or 2. Other times only 1 or 2 are availables. This options depends on the data and can be changed in future
